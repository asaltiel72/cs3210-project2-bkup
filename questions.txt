Plans
-library
-init function


mmap struct to manage space
free list struct
	location
	int free
	size
mmap to expand
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Plan post meeting

Tree structure
	head pointer
	nodes
		location
		size
		state
		left child
		right child

when some portion of the tree become occupied (representable by sate at levels)
mmap more space
	can allocate beginning at end of first alloc so as to expand
when some amount is freed, munmap space
	make sure not to remove original allocation
	rearrange data into minimal tree before munmap (how?)

LOCKS
	tree access
	memory allocation
	head pointer
